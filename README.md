# Exploratory Project

## Contents of the Project

Project folder contains six items amongst which four are the python files, one folder(Datasets) for datasets and one is the information file(README.md).

#### Four Pythons Files are :

1. FinalResult.py is the file where one can obtain the final accuracy of the model corresponding to the dataset by calling RSVMPDProx, which is the proposed technique for this paper.
2. RSVMPDProx.py is the file which mainly implements the proposed rescaled alpha-hinge loss function with non-smooth regularizer.
3. PDProxDual.py is the file which implements SVM with non-smooth regularizer and conventional hinge loss function which is also non-smooth.
4. Fista.py is the algorithm used for implementing point 5 of the algorithm given in the paper.
